# HRUH webpage

Hematology Research Unit Helsinki is a translational research group, which aims to understand the pathobiology of malignant blood diseases (such as leukemia) and related autoimmune disorders and to find novel therapy targets and modes of action. Tumor immunology, both in hematological malignancies and solid tumors, is also our focus area. We combine basic cancer research with clinical drug studies and our long-term goal is to develop curative treatment strategies for patients.
