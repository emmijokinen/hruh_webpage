## scRepertoire
Please follow the [scRepertoire](https://github.com/ncborcherding/scRepertoire) workflow. You should try to put your scTCRseq data as soon as possible to your scRNAseq data, in order to analyze the QC, cell types etc with more confidence. 

## Ideas

What you can do with scTCRab-seq:

* estimate the clonality of clusters / samples / timepoints
* track individual clone through time / perturbations / different objects (e.g., in vivo and in vitro)
* predict the specifities with TCRGP
* cluster TCRs with the same similatiries with GLIPH2

Have a look at [this](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-33720-z), [this](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-29173-z) and especially [this](https://www.google.com/search?q=huuhtanen+lag3+jci&oq=huuhtanen+lag3+jci&aqs=chrome..69i57.2700j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) to get an idea what has already been done.
