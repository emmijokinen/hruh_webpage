## How this website was created?

This webpage is created with [MDWiki](http://dynalon.github.io/mdwiki/#!index.md). The file can be found "locally" on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1MGgytFVDFtaLxjRYaMF_9mCRfOU406gc) and on Jani's computer.

Basically this webpage is just a collection of [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) documents, which are held in the Google Drive -folder and hoster with DriveToWeb-application through the mdwiki.html -file (javascript). 

The Google Drive -folder and hence this webpage is open to public, but are not indexed by Google so in theory the Google Drive and this page is hard to find without a link but still vulnerable.

## How to edit instructions in this website

Basically this webpage is just a collection of [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) documents, so you just need to edit the Markdown files. There are multiple ways of doing that, but the simplest is:

* the GitHub way: edit the .md files straight in [this repo](https://github.com/janihuuh/hruh_webpage).

Tips on markdown can be found e.g. [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). A text editor is adviced, e.g. [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [MacDown](https://macdown.uranusjr.com/)

## How to add new subsection to this website

To add subsections to this website,

* Create a new file in the repo
* Add it to navigation.md in the folder, like the previous documents have been. You can look for tips from [MDwiki website](http://dynalon.github.io/mdwiki/#!index.md).

The file should be updated it automagically after the file is in the folder, force refresh (Cmd+R) could give it the final push if needed.
