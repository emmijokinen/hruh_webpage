## How to host a website using MDWiki, Google Drive and DriveToWeb

This webpage is created with [MDWiki](http://dynalon.github.io/mdwiki/#!index.md), [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1GS1hFvEuJPP3EaYjt--6MBv4rv93AbWu) and [DriveToWeb](https://drv.tw/).

Basically this webpage is just a collection of [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) documents, which are held in the Google Drive -folder and hoster with DriveToWeb-application through the mdwiki.html -file. 

The Google Drive -folder and hence this webpage is open to public, but is not indexed by Google so in theory this page is hard to find.

## How to edit instructions in this website

Basically this webpage is just a collection of [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) documents, so you just need to edit the Markdown files:

* Find the instruction markdown file (.md) you would like to edit in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1GS1hFvEuJPP3EaYjt--6MBv4rv93AbWu). *It should be obvious which file contains which information, e.g. git.md contains information on How to git.*
* Edit the things you'd like to change in the 

Tips on markdown can be found e.g. [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). A text editor is adviced, e.g. [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [MacDown](https://macdown.uranusjr.com/)

## How to add new subsection to this website

To add subsections to this website,

* Create a markdown document
* Upload it to the public folder in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1GS1hFvEuJPP3EaYjt--6MBv4rv93AbWu) 
* Add it to navigation.md in the folder

The file should be updated it automagically after the file is in the folder, force refresh (Cmd+R) could give it the final push if needed.

## GitHub

The project is also in [GitHub](https://github.com/janihuuh/hruh_bioinformatics). The webpage could be also hosted from github in the future to have a more human-readable domain.
